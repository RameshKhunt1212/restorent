		Social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks.<br> The Office of Communications and Marketing manages the main Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube accounts.<br>

We offer an array of tools, including one-on-one consults with schools, departments and offices looking to form or maintain an existing social media presence to discuss social media goals and strategy, as well as offer insights and ideas. <br>Before creating any social media account, you must submit the Account Request Form. Be sure to check with your school’s communications office for any school specific regulations or branding guidelines.

			<h2>Key Principles for Social Media Managers:</h2>
			<li>Social media is about conversations, community, connecting with the audience and building relationships. It is not just a broadcast channel or a sales and marketing tool.</li><br>
			<li>Authenticity, honesty and open dialogue are key.</li><br>
			<li>Social media not only allows you to hear what people say about you, but enables you to respond. Listen first, speak second.</li><br>
			<li>Be compelling, useful, relevant and engaging. Don’t be afraid to try new things, but think through your efforts before kicking them off.</li><br>
