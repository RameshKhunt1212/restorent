		<h3>Everything you need to know about video editing..</h3>
		<p>When it comes to creating a film or any other kind of video project, much of the magic you see on-screen comes from great editing. It is quite astounding what a video editor can create. They start with a monumental mess of stuff, then cut and trim the pieces together.<br> The final result is a complete story in video format. Video editing truly is where the magic happens, so let us dive into the basics of what you need to know.<br>
			<h3>What is a video editor?</h3>
A video editor’s core function is to cut, trim and sequence separate video clips into a comprehensive narrative structure. <br>This sequence eventually becomes the final release of a film or video. The video editor needs to understand aspects of the pre-production phase — such as the shot lists and storyboarding — and from the production phase — such as continuity and cinematography. <br><br>

The video editor spends most, if not all, of their time in post-production. This is where they possess the majority of their skills. It is essential to learn a few key terms in the video, audio and color categories to grasp how to work on a project.
