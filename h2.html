	Adobe Photoshop, computer application software used to edit and manipulate digital images. Photoshop was developed in 1987 by the American brothers Thomas and John Knoll, who sold the distribution license to Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1988.
	Photoshop was originally conceived as a subset of the popular design software Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe expected to sell a modest several hundred copies per month. Expectations for Photoshop’s success were tempered by concerns over the capabilities of personal computers (PCs) in the early 1990s to run the program because it required more computer memory than most PCs came with or even, in some cases, than could be installed. Nevertheless, the software sold well, driving sales of newer PCs with more memory and becoming known as one of the first “killer apps” (an application that influences hardware sales). Photoshop became integral to many diverse industries, including publishing, Web design, medicine, film, advertising, engineering, and architecture. In 1995 Adobe purchased the rights to Photoshop from the Knoll brothers for $34.5 million. The demand for Photoshop rose as computers improved and digital photography technology advanced. The program’s success spawned companies that produce add-ons designed specifically for Photoshop compatibility.
