		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p>jQuery, at its core, is a Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation library. The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page. jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. For example, jQuery can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain property (e.g. all elements with an h1 tag), changing one or more of its attributes (e.g. color, visibility), or making it respond to an event (e.g. a mouse click).<br>

jQuery also provides a paradigm for event handling that goes beyond basic DOM element selection and manipulation. The event assignment and the event callback function definition are done in a single step in a single location in the code. jQuery also aims to incorporate other highly used JavaScript functionality (e.g. fade ins and fade outs when hiding elements, animations by manipulating CSS properties).</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
jQuery includes the following features:

<li>DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project[20]</li>
<li>DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that uses elements' names and attributes, such as id and class, as criteria to select nodes in the DOM</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Effects and animations</li>
<li>Ajax</li>
<li>Deferred and Promise objects to control asynchronous processing</li>
<li>JSON parsing</li>
<li>Extensibility through plug-ins</li>
<li>Utilities, such as feature detection</li>
<li>Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers, but need fallbacks for older browsers, such as jQuery.inArray() and jQuery.each().</li>
<li>Cross-browser support</li>
</ul>
